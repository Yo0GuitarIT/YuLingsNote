# Introduction Inheritance

_One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is **inheritance**.
Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application.
This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionaltiy and speeds up implementation time._
